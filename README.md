## :star2: About the Project

<img width="933" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107268440/190730760-fbb75e4e-620d-4fa4-9643-ed8d77338efb.png">

PLEARN is a virtual board game to raise youths’ awareness about financial literacy. It is the new board game pioneer that introduces a financial management tool to the market that is based on blockchain and built in the Metaverse. Moreover, with the increasing importance of sustainable investments in the financial market, youth will inevitably be confronted with sustainable investment options when deciding how to allocate their assets. But without a proper knowledge of sustainability and its inclusion in financial products, youth will not be able to  make informed investment decisions and achieve efficient market outcomes. When this knowledge is absent or insufficient, youth become prone to possibly misleading marketing and manipulation by financial providers. As a game creator, we intend to empower youth with strong financial literacy to be able to make savvy financial decisions through allowing participants to play PLEARN  in order to learn how to manage their finances via its four pillars: **Trading deals, Real estate deals, Auction market deals, and ESGROW.**

**ESGROW** is a launchpad platform where users can join to submit their own ESG - related projects. By participating in Impact Investing with the express goal of generating and measuring mission-related social, environmental or economic change alongside financial return then can participate in crowdfunding to help them raise funds for their projects through voting, minting NFTs, and raising funds from the NFT marketplace. Capturing an appropriate return is critical to do so, as this will ensure that the fund will be able to carry out the interests of the users by building stronger alliances with frontline communities most greatly impacted by the extractive economy and working towards a just transition towards regenerative finance.


<!-- Problem -->
## :bomb: Problem
Regardless of the ongoing attention and the rise in ESG investments, investors yet people with ESG-related ideas are still finding challenges to collaborate. For investors, they find it challenging in finding a service provider who can provide them with the right information so they can make the right investment  decision and to be greenwashed by false information. From the entrepreneurs' side, they are trying to validate their ideas and provide the information that proves their ESG-related projects.  

<!-- Solution -->
## :woman_technologist: Solution

It is all about sustainable finance and its importance in making savvy financial decisions– the integration of environmental, social, and governance factors into the investment decision-making process, has been a trending topic in financial markets in recent years as investors’ money flowed into bonds, stocks, and portfolios with an ESG focus. This trend towards allocating capital for ESG assets and goals is a crucial part of the transformation towards a more sustainable economy. Moreover, everyone should understand these concepts to amplify the beneficial effect on society and induce a change in investment habits for retail investors. As a result, sustainable financial literacy, meaning an understanding of sustainable financial products and their use for promoting sustainable development goals – plays a key role in the integration of ESG factors into financial decisions. The first step in achieving sustainable finance literacy is creating awareness. While the financial sector is advancing at great speed towards integrating ESG factors in financial decision-making, teaching sustainable finance lags behind. Teaching sustainable finance courses is therefore essential. However, to create awareness we need more than specialized courses and here when **ESGROW  was born**.

We have created a crowdfunding launchpad platform, **ESGROW. In ESGROW**, we help both investors as well as entrepreneurs to grow. We aim to ESGROW together. Through introducing a solution where entrepreneurs can share their innovative solutions that are related to poverty, better education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, life below the water, and climate action with the public for their new projects and involving the public, including investors, to decide if this is a valid idea or not, we have created a space for both parties to meet. We created the space for investors to also study the project before starting to invest in it. through ESGROW platform, everyone can vote for the project that can serve the society more and introduces more innovative solutions to the current problems.

Participants, before submitting their own projects, will go through a learning process. To learn about sustainable finance and how it affects our daily life decisions. This will also help them better understand the importance of the ESG in our daily 
life. We are creating a platform where entrepreneurs can learn and bring up innovative solutions and share them with the public with full transparency, which in return, investors can have full access to the data and information they need before starting investing their money. Participants, through the platform can submit innovative solutions in many different ESG categories and we give the opportunity to participate and choose the most innovative solution.

  1- Airdrops:
    
      - Solution: We have used chainlink to automate the "airdrop" function of the smart contracts
    
  2- AWS:
    
     - The varities AWS provide in terms of tools, databases and products,creates a difficulty in choosing the right tool for the project.
       Solution: We start with databases relating to the environment topics, which can narrow down the confusion and timing.

#### Challenges we ran into
We are facing the challenges of transferring the technology from Web 2 to Web 3. Our biggest challenge was the FNFT smart contrats, as this subbject is new to the team, we were facing some difficulties in building smart contracts, however, witht the support and the collaboration between team members, we were able to overcome this issue.

#### Accomplishments that we're proud of
The collaboration of the team made achieving the milestones of the project in a short period of time and within the deadline feasible. 

#### What we learned
We have learned about the GameFi market, the Web 3 ecosystem, and how to integrate sustainable finance in blockchain to create a useful product. We have also learned about the FNFT which is a new topic for our team, however, we have managed to run, the FNFT smart contract, successfully.

#### What's next for ESGROW?
ESGROW will be part of a bigger project, **PLEARN**, which is a game aims at teaching financial literacy. ESGROW, will present the fourth pillar of the game which is the ESG-related projects deal. Once it is integrated into the game, participants will have the chance to learn about the importance of sustainable finance in making their financial decisions.

---
### GOVERNANCE 

 **Governance Token**
 
   - **MANI**: is the governance token of the main project, **PLEARN ( PLAY.LEARN.EARN)**
     Users can acquire MANI either through buying it directly from the platform, or through the completion of the learning process when they play PLEARN.
     Only users who hold MANI can participate in submitting/voting process. We will airdrop users with two tokens in order to partipiate in both the submission and the voting process. However, these tokens can be used to vote twice, including their own project.
